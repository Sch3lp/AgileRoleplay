AgileRoleplay
=============

Roleplay exercises that show IT'ers with an Agile mindset how they, often indirectly, affect their customers culture. Which might positively or negatively influence their project's success.

The scenario's are based on personal experiences, but the actors names are changed to preserve their anonimity.

All of the scoring is based on [Michael Sahota's Agile Adoption and Transformation Survival Guide](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/agile-adoption-transformation).

# How to use this repository

Dungeon Master scenario's are in the [dungeonmaster](/dungeonmaster) directory. They describe the scenario's for the dungeon master's perspective.

Team scenario's are in the [team](/team) directory. They describe the same scenario's of the dungeon master, but for the team's perspective.

In the [host](/host) directory you'll find documents on how to run your own roleplay session. You'll find information on what your role should be, some extra's to make it even more fun, and notes on when to step in and help out a group.
