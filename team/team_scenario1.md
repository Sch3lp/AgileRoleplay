# Scenario 1

Agilistas Inc. won a project in which the client asked to transform his business into an agile one.

They have a small internal project in mind where they want to apply the agile values that Agilistas Inc. is known for. Delivering the project on time and within budget is one of the metrics that the client will use to determine how well we have done our job.

The client agreed on a co-sourcing solution, in which Agilistas Inc. developers will work alongside the clients developers to successfully deliver this project.

## First conversation

### Context

Your team will meet with one of the middle managers whose role recently includes implementing agile throughout his company. The meeting serves as a meet & greet of both parties, and as a kick-off to the project. This is your chance to make sure that Agilistas Inc.’s agile values will work in delivering all of the clients projects successfully, this one and future projects.

## Second conversation

### Context

The project isn’t going so well, it doesn’t seem like you’re going to meet the deadline.

Current problems that are known: 

One of the co-sourcing devs, you’ll know which one it is, is not working on the stories that should deliver value, but he’s been doing “performance improvements” instead.

The waste snake showed that the clients custom Selenium framework - that has been forced on your the team - is costing about 40% of the total time to develop a story.

A meeting was called by the big boss, who got the entire team together with the middle manager, in the hopes of sorting stuff out. So that the project might still be delivered on time. It was specifically mentioned by the big boss that he doesn’t care how you do it, as long as it gets delivered.

There are a lot of eyes directed at this project, so depending on the outcome of this project, the big boss might look like a fool to try Agile, or make him a hero.
