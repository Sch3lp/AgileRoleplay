Scenario 2
Cegeka is finishing up a project (non co-sourcing) with a client. Because the client noticed how well the project is going, they asked us to transform a different team into an agile one.
They have a small internal project in mind for this purpose. Since we’ve already proven our worth, the client trusts quite a lot in Cegeka’s proficiency in working agile.
And they are also quite open-minded.
However, there are a lot of rumours in the office:
Overheard: Cegeka brags a lot about their “Agile” way of working. Boasting that it’s proven successful in many projects already.
First conversation
Context
Our project lead at the client introduces us to the lead of the small internal project. He will have many questions. Explain how we work, try not to scare him off.
You know that there are highly skilled developers and some juniors working on his team.
He works similar to how your current project lead used to work: 3 week development, 2 week testing, 1 week production.
Roll for initiative 

Second conversation
Context
The project is going great. Our agile principles have seeped through to the rest of the team and none of the developers can imagine not pairing or practicing TDD anymore.
The juniors seemed to have made a lot of progress after pairing was introduced.
Since our contract is nearing its end, and the project is almost complete, we need to try and make sure that they stay on the right path.
Current continuous improvement practices in place after 3 months: retrospectives and code reviews. No other practices were suggested yet.
This conversation takes place after a short retrospective that looked back over the entire project.
