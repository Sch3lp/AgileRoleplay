# Read this if you're new to roleplaying games
Stereotypically when you think of RolePlaying games you might think of Dungeons & Dragons, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, magic and monsters.
And the four-eyed, acne-ridden nerds that sit in a dimly lit room, around a round table with curious looking figurines on it.

Well sorry to burst your bubble, but we'll do sort of the "light" version of this, with less fantasy elements.
But it's **your** adventure, so feel free to incorporate as many fantasies as you like.

The goal of a Dungeon Master in your typical Roleplaying game is to guide the game and the players through an adventure.
To successfully do this, he or she will have to act, or _roleplay_, all other characters that the players come across.

Another common thing in roleplaying games is to roll the many-sided dice to see how you and your players fare when they perform actions.
These come into play when a dungeon master will translate a players actions over to the rules of the game you're playing.

For example if a player shouts _"I jump up from my chair, over the table and swing my sword at the green orc!"_, a good dungeon master will reply with _"Roll 1 D10 and then a D4 for me please."_

The first roll will be to check if the player is able to actually jump over the table, and hit the orc, and the second roll is to see how much damage the hit will do.

This roleplaying game is a bit easier, in that the DM only plays one role, and you can reserve your rolls for the very end of the scenario, just make sure you write down how many rolls of which kind your players have to do.

Which dice the players have to roll for which action is explained in the scenarios.
But basically in this game, we'll roll dice to see how well the team scores on moving a team towards better Agile practices and mindsets.

That's about all there is to it, if you have further questions, go ask the host for info! And have fun!
