# DM Scenario 2

You are a project lead, whose projects are delivered in time. There is no incentive to switch to Agile.

You and your team are about to finish a project successfully, and you’ve come to learn that your team’s next challenge is a small internal project where you will be working alongside developers of Cegeka.

Cegeka is already present at your company, finishing up a different project successfully. 

There are a lot of rumours in the office:

Cegeka seems to brag a lot about their “Agile” way of working. Boasting that it’s proven successful in many projects already. But you’re not convinced yet and decide to put it to the test.

You trust a lot in your way of working. It’s been working great until now, and you’re always on the lookout for things to improve. So you’re a bit skeptical, but still open-minded in general.

You have trustworthy and highly skilled developers (about 4 of them), who’ve been with the company for 8 years, building their technical skills over a bunch of projects.

However, there are also a bunch of new hires (4 of them in your team), who seem to be having trouble improving at a considerable speed. They’re constantly lagging behind with what they’re supposed to deliver. You don’t understand because they have had a lot of in-house training already.

## DM Scenario 2 - First conversation

### Context

The lead of the project that’s being finished (by cegeka) introduces you to the cegeka team. You want to learn about how they work and what they will do to make your team perform better.

Your current way of working involves delivering a war every 3 weeks, that gets tested for 2 weeks by the testers, and goes into production a week later. So it takes 6 weeks in total for features to be delivered. 

You’re very proud of the fact that there are almost never bugs discovered in production.

Sometimes it will happen that in the 2 weeks the testers are at it, the team has to work overtime to fix many bugs that are being reported.

### How to act

You give the Cegeka team the benefit of the doubt.

Keep calm and ask subjective questions.

### How to score

In general: the stronger the cegeka team makes suggestions that move away from competence (see Schneider Model), the less points they’re going to get. Here are some guidelines you can follow.

They will probably explain what Scrum, Pair Programming, TDD, … is, and how they are applying it in their team, but they should not suggest to start doing those things right from the start at your team.

Suggesting to do hardcore Scrum, Pair Programming, TDD, … gets a penalty per time they suggest one of these.

Suggesting to do agile practices without actually using the agile terminology gets point per time they suggest this. This is quite difficult to notice, but you can listen for sentences like “Why don’t we work together for, let’s say 2 weeks, and then see how far we are already?”.

Suggesting to actively pursue Software Craftsmanship gets points.

Suggesting to stick with the way you’re working now gets +5 points, even if it’s only temporary (for example, they can suggest to stick with the way you’re working now for the next month).

## DM Scenario 2 - Second conversation

### Context

The project is going great. Cegeka’s agile principles have seeped through to your team and none of your developers can imagine not pairing or practicing TDD anymore.

You’ve also noticed that your juniors are picking up technical skills at a rapid pace. Seems like pairing was all they really needed.

Since Cegeka’s contract is nearing its end, and the project is almost complete, you do worry a little about what it will be like without them.

You want to make sure that your team can keep on making these great results, also without Cegeka developers.

Current continuous improvement practices in place after 3 months: retrospectives and code reviews. You don’t know about other practices.

This conversation takes place after a short retrospective that looked back over the entire project.

### How to act

Be honest and thankful; tell them what you’re really thinking:

You are worried that your team might fall back to being not so highly performing.

### How to score

In general: they need to suggest to keep on doing what you’re doing now, and keep on inspecting and adapting.

All suggestions directing to continuous improvement get points.

e.g. retrospectives, reading groups, competence centers, code reviews, ...

Suggesting to form a guild gets +5 points, this fits really well with their already existing Competence culture, and will get other teams excited as well. Slowly moving the company to a cultivation culture, which is more receptive to Agile.

If they never mention to keep on doing the current practices they get a penalty.

Suggesting to convince other teams to work agile gets a penalty (they should not try to make an agile evangelist out of you).
