#DM Scenario 1

You are a middle-manager who got the assignment of your boss to transform his team to agile, but you don't want to.
You think the way you’re working now is fine, you deliver your projects “on time”. If the customer complains, then you’ll find some excuse, and find someone in the team to be held responsible.

You mainly want to keep working the way you are now, because you’re afraid that middle-management (your job) will become useless.

So you have to be careful, you don’t want to show the team that you’re anti-agile, so you’ll “allow” some agile practices, but you need to make sure that whenever reporting is done to your boss, that the agile team comes off badly.

You are in a company that is influenced heavily by its command-and-control culture.
From an outsiders perspective, the blame game can be seen everywhere.

You will sometimes give contradictory responses to the questions the team asks. For example if they ask you “how much time does it usually take to deliver a project”, first time they ask you say 6 months, second time they ask you say 3 months.


## DM Scenario 1 - First conversation

### Context

You are being presented to the team that will be put into place to prove that “Agile” is going to work. The contract states that it is a co-sourcing project, so you decide to put your most loyal developer in the team, and your general plan is to have him sabotage the team a little once in awhile.
Your guy has a bunch of certificates, and has been working at your company for 8 years. You can also mention that he’s a member of your company’s architectural board. So his competence is very good. (If you feel up to it you can play this guy’s role as well)

The “small internal project” is a glorified holiday sheet. 
Employees can enter their holidays up to 14 days in advance. After that they can’t add them anymore, and will have to go through their people manager to put in a holiday request. 

Your company always has set teams. There are still teams who have been working steadily together for the last 5 years.
Try to make sure that the discussion remains in the agile values domain, and less about the project itself. Modelling the project isn’t the point of this exercise.

### How to act

You want to seem excited about working Agile.
Agree with nearly everything the team says/suggests.

### How to score

In general: the stronger the cegeka team makes suggestions that move away from command & control/competence (see Schneider Model), the less points they’re going to get. Here are some guidelines you can follow.

Suggesting to do Scrum, Pair Programming, TDD, … gets a D4 ![D4] penalty per time they suggest one of these.

Suggesting to do agile practices without actually using the agile terminology gets D4 ![D4] point per time they suggest this. This is quite difficult to notice, but you can listen for sentences like “Why don’t we work together for, let’s say 2 weeks, and then see how far we are already?”.

Suggesting to do KanBan do gets D4 ![D4] points.

Suggesting to stick with the way you’re working now gets D10 ![D10] +5 points, even if it’s only temporary (for example, they can suggest to stick with the way you’re working now for the next month).

## DM Scenario 1 - Second conversation

### Context

The project isn’t going so well, it doesn’t seem like you’re going to meet the deadline. You are convinced that if the team just moves back to the way you are used to working, that you can still meet the deadline.

Current problems that are known: 
* “your guy” was proven (by their scrum or kanban system) to not be working on the stories that should deliver value, but he’s been doing “performance improvements” instead.
* According to the team, the company’s custom Selenium framework that the team has been obligated to use is costing about 40% of the total time to develop a “story”.
The project might be able to be finished on time if they drop that non-functional requirement. Do not suggest this yourself.

Roll for initiative D20 ![D20]

### How to act

You are furious. If the team would not have worked agile, but in the way you are used to, you feel that the deadline would have been met.

### How to score

In general: the faster stuff fails in the coming weeks, the more points they’re going to get. Fail Hard, Fail Early. This will leave an open window for introducing agile values. Here are some guidelines you can follow.

Suggesting to drop the custom selenium framework they get D10 ![D10] points.

Suggesting to replace it with actual webdriver tests they get a bonus D4 ![D4] points.

Suggesting to have testers test earlier gets D10 ![D10] points.

Suggesting to inform higher ups that the project is not going to get delivered on time gets D4 ![D4] points.

Suggesting to drop unit testing (if they’re already doing this) gets D10 ![D10] **penalties**.

Merely suggesting to put more responsibility on “your guy” gets D10 ![D10] **penalties**.

However, suggesting to put more responsibility on “your guy” in the next week and see how that goes gets D4 ![D4] points.
