Setup
=====

## The idea aka the why
A lot of developers that get sent to customers on co-sourcing contracts are not aware that they're sometimes forcing their culture on them.

This impedes collaboration and can have a negative impact on the outcome of the project.

To generate awareness for this problem and to teach what you can do about it yourself can be very powerful knowledge.

## Preparations
A group consists out of 1 Dungeon Master and 3-4 players.

Decide how many groups you want to facilitate. More than 6 is difficult to host by yourself, so get help.

Make sure you have the following equipment to bring along:
* Printouts of DM Scenario's (1 per group)
* Printouts of Player Scenario's (2 per group)
* A set of roleplaying dice (minimally one of each: D20, D4, D10) (1 set per group)
* Binders (full of women) or something else that will block the view of the players on the DM's papers (1 per group)
* Working (!) pens, sharpies, pencils, markers, ...
* Draft paper (for people to write on to prepare)
* Some sort of timer. (Smartphone, cooking-timer, ...)

Provide a room that is large enough to put the number of groups you wish to facilitate. Keep in mind that you don't want your groups to be sitting too close to each other. Otherwise they might cheat and choose strategies invented by other groups. This is a case where you do NOT want a lot of osmosis between teams. :) 

When choosing a room, also try and pay attention to a rooms acoustics. Bad acoustics can lead to a very chaotic session and is less enjoyable for everyone. So if you have the choice, make it count.

Running the exercise
=======================

### Making groups
Call out to the attendees to select/volunteer a number of DM's. Make sure managers do not end up as a DM. They can learn a lot of this exercise, both the culture clashing and how being a developer feels like.

Have the DM's move in different corners.

Have the rest of the attendees make groups of 3-4 players and have the player groups choose a DM. Once the groups are formed, have 1 member of each player group rotate to the next one.

### Explaining
While you have the players read their scenario's, gather the DM's and explain how to run a scenario in their roleplaying group. Have them read their DM scenario's and provide time for questions.

### Provisioning
Provide each DM with: 
- a set of roleplaying dice (minimally one of each: D20, D4, D10)
- a set of DM Scenario sheets
- a scoring sheet
- a working pen/pencil
- a binder, or something else that will block the view from the players to the DM's papers.
- the schneider model explanation

## An example
**TODO**

## Bonus

For Scenario 1, conversation 2, you can quietly exit the room, if anyone asks you're going to the toilet or whatever.
Wait a while and then suddenly LOUDLY knock on the door and just storm in as the raging CEO of the company of the DM.
Start yelling that you're sick and tired of this bullshit about the different development methods not working, and that you demand a solution, whatever development method they choose to use.
You don't care anymore about the agile coaching contract, you only want the product delivered on time, no matter what.
